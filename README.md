This is a port of [facebook page post scrapper](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper) from [minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir). 
  
I've been using this script for a while and been patching things to fit my use case. It ended up beeing a mutant version of the original, so I've made a careless refactoring recently and decided to put on my github.

I've decided to leave the original comments as is, but added some extra information.
